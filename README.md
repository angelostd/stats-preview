## My process

  Using CSS variables, first I make the Mobile site because is easier to organize in the header, main-card and footer than in the desktop preview.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Media queries, and the useful 'background-blend-mode' to recreate to photo effect.

### Continued development

I'm not complety clear of the use of @media, need to improve this.
